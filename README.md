# QFlightsInstruments_Arduino
An Arduino-integrated interface for visualizing gyrometer data in a stunning aviation display using QFlightInstruments widgets.



QFlightInstruments is a powerful Qt library designed to simplify the creation of Flight User Interfaces (UIs). It offers a collection of essential flight instruments and an Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS) widget suite for developers building aviation-related applications.

## Key Features
• Comprehensive Instrumentation: QFlightInstruments provides a comprehensive set of flight instruments, including an Airspeed Indicator, Altimeter, Vertical Speed Indicator, Turn Coordinator, Attitude Indicator, Heading Indicator, Electronic Attitude Direction Indicator (EADI), and Electronic Horizontal Situation Indicator (EHSI).
• Seamless Integration: Developers can easily integrate these instruments into their Qt-based applications, allowing them to create realistic and functional flight displays.
• Arduino Integration: The library seamlessly integrates with Arduino devices, such as the Arduino Mega with a gyrometer. This capability enables real-time data retrieval and visualization, making it suitable for flight simulation and aviation-related projects.
